# Transaction type data structure

Each [transaction type](/blockchain/transaction-type.md) has a unique set of fields that define its **data structure**.

## Data structure versions

During the time the transaction's data structure may change. We use versions to distinguish the old data structures from new.

At the present moment, most of our transaction types have two versions of data structures: v2 and v1. The v2 should be used over v1 whenever is possible.
