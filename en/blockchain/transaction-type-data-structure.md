# Transaction type data structure

Each [transaction type](/blockchain/transaction-type.md) has a unique set of fields that define its **data structure**.

Over time, the data structure of a transaction type may change. We use versions to distinguish multiple data structures.

Currently, most of the transaction types have at least two versions: v2 and v1.
