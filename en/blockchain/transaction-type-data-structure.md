# Transaction type data structure

Each [transaction type](/blockchain/transaction-type.md) has a unique set of fields that define its **data structure**.

## Versions

Over time, transaction data structures may change. We use versions to distinguish outdated data structures from the most recent ones.

Currently, most of our transaction types have at least two versions of data structure: v2 and v1.
