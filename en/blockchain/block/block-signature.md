# Block signature

A **block signature** is a hash that miner acquires when he signs the [block](/blockchain/block.md) with his private key.

Hashing is done by [SHA-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hash function which requires two input parameters:

1. Private key of the miner
2. Bytes of the [block](/blockchain/block.md)
