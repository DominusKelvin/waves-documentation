# Address

An **address** is a unique identifier of an [account](/blockchain/account.md).

Each account has a _single_ address.

The address allows the user to view the balance. [Tokens](/blockchain/token.md) can be sent to the address.

The address can be represented as an alphanumeric string or a scanned QR code.
