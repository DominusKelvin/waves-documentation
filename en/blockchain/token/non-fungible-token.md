# Non-fungible token

A **non-fungible token** or **NFT** is a special type of [token](/blockchain/token.md), that represents some _unique_ object.

Two regular tokens cannot be distinguished from each other â€” they are alike, i.e. _fungible_. Each NFT token is unique, and therefore NFTs are _non-fungible_. Any two NFTs can always be distinguished.

Every NFT has a unique ID.

NFT is most commonly used in games.

## Issue of non-fungible tokens

The issue of a single non-fungible token is made by an issue transaction; for such a transaction, the value of the "Amount" field equals 1, and the values of the fields "Number of decimal places" and "Reissue flag" equal 0.

To issue NFTs you can also use the [waves-games](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@waves/waves-games) npm package.

The fee for the issue of a single NFT is 0.001 [WAVES](/blockchain/token/waves.md).
