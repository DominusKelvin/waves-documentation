# Account

An **account** is a mathematically bound pair of public and private keys.

> A pair is considered an account if the public key of the pair has participated in at least one [transaction](/blockchain/transaction.md) in the blockchain, i.e. it was recorded to at least one block

Each account has a _single_ [address](/blockchain/address.md).

Each account has an [account data storage](/blockchain/account-data-storage.md).
