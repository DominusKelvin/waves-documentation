# Account

An **account** is a mathematically bound public and private keys.

> A bound of public and private keys is considered an account if the public key has participated in at least one transaction in the blockchain, i.e. it was recorded to at least one block. <br><br>It's possible to generate a bound outside of the blockchain â€” such a bound is not considered an account

Each account has a _single_ [address](/blockchain/address.md).

Each account has an [account data storage](/blockchain/account-data-storage.md).
