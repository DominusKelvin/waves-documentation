# Waves IDE

## About

The main goal of [Waves Web IDE](https://ide.wavesplatform.com) is to give developers a great tool for developing [RIDE smart contracts](/waves-environment/waves-protocol/smart-contracts.md).  
the user can set default seed, default network byte and node url via the IDE settings. The IDE is also supported by [console\(REPL\)](/developer-tools/repl.md).
