# Waves IDE

 **Waves IDE** is a development environment (<https://ide.wavesplatform.com>) that allows creating and testing [RIDE scripts](/ride/ride-script.md).

## Debugging

There is no way to debug a RIDE script in the Waves IDE. The best way to check if the script works fine is to write tests and run them in the [test network](/blockchain/testnet.md).
