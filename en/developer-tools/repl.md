The console allows:

* sign and send [transactions](/blockchain/transaction.md)
* retrieve the information about account balance
* read the data from the [account data storage](/blockchain/account-data-storage.md)
* send and cancel orders on DEX

You can write in the console any JavaScript code, including one that makes calls to the methods of the JavaScript library [Waves Transactions](https://github.com/wavesplatform/waves-transactions). The documentation on the Waves Transactions is available on [GitHub](https://wavesplatform.github.io/waves-transactions/).

The console also has objects and methods for accessing the Waves IDE's environment.
