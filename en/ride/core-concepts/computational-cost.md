# Computational cost
To estimate the computing resources that are required to execute a RIDE script, the term **computational cost** is used.

The computational cost of a RIDE script is estimated based on the computational cost of all the [operators](/ride/operators.md) and [functions](/ride/functions.md) it consists of. Different operators and functions have different computational cost.
