# About RIDE language
**RIDE** â€” is a programming language that's used for writing decentralised applications (dApps) in Waves blockchain.

## The history of the language
RIDE was created in 2018. The [white paper](https://wavesplatform.com/files/docs/white_paper_waves_smart_contracts.pdf) of the language was published at that time also.

It would be quite difficult to take some existing programming language as the basis and tailor it to our needs. That's why we decided to create a new language from scratch, keeping in mind the following ideas:

1. RIDE has to be blockchain-friendly. Scripts, written in RIDE, have to execute fast, and there should be no overload on the blockchain network that would degrade its performance.
2. RIDE has to be developer-friendly. That's why RIDE is a [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing) language with the [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking).

## Lack of Turing completeness
RIDE language was designed as not [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). Turing-incompleteness is a result of the absence of loops, recursions and goto-like expressions in the language. Absence of such constructs lets us know in advance, how much processing power will be required to execute the script written in RIDE. So, because of that, we know in advance the complexity of the operation, its calculational "cost". As a result, we can be sure that any calculational operation in the Waves blockchain will complete. Because the processing complexity is known beforehand, we don't need [gas](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3/what-is-meant-by-the-term-gas), as in the case with Ethereum, for example. We can just limit the maximum allowed number of calculations per one script by some cap value.

## Some facts about RIDE language
- RIDE is based on expressions.
- RIDE language is [lazy](/smart-contracts/ride-language/immutable-variables-and-the-let-keyword.md) by design.
- RIDE is not an object-oriented language. By paradigm, RIDE is rather a functional programming language.
- RIDE is case-sensitive. Because of that, the variables `myVar` and `myVAR` will be treated as different variables.
