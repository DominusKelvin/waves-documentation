# What is a decentralised application (dApp)
A **decentralised application** (**dApp**) is an application, that is executed in a distributed computer system, for instance, in a blockchain.

In particular, Waves dApp is a distributed application, written in [RIDE language](/smart-contracts/ride-language/about-ride-language.md), and executed on the nodes of Waves blockchain.

It's also possible to define a dApp as a Waves account with the attached script, containing at least one callable function that can be called with the Invoke Script-transaction.
