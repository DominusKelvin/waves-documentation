# Oracle

Blockchains do not have direct access to the data from the outside world. Blockchains cannot retrieve the information such as currency exchange rates, weather forecasts or, for example, stock market prices directly from the internet. Oracles are here to help as the interfaces that connect a blockchain with the external world.

An **oracle** is an agent, that sends data from the outside world to the blockchain (**inbound oracle**), or from the blockchain to the outside world (**outbound oracle**).

Oracles may be used by smart contracts.
